Having lived in Missoula with his wife and son for the last 22 years, Neil says he still misses the opportunity to photograph professional ballet companies.</p> <p>When he heard the news in early 2009 that the Moscow Ballet was visiting Montana, he jumped at the chance to photograph them behind the scenes. Gaining permission to follow the troupe from Butte to Helena to Missoula proved to be an involved and time-consuming process, but one that was well worth the effort.</p> <p>The results of Neil's time spent traveling with these world-renowned dancers can be seen this coming Friday at Rocky Mountain School of Photography Gallery located at 216 N. Higgins Avenue in downtown Missoula. Neil will be present at the opening, which runs from 5 to 8 p.m. <b>The RMSP Gallery will also be open on Saturday December 4 from 1 to 4 p.m. as part of downtown Missoula's Parade of Lights.</b></p> <p>(<a href=\"http://blog.rmsp.com/2010/11/05/the-moscow-ballet-an-interview-with-neil-chaput-de-saintonge/\"> Read Neil's interview here</a>)</p>", "created": 1291141008000, "venue": {"city": "Missoula", "name": "Rocky Mountain School of Photography", "zip": "59802", "country": "us", "lon": -113.994355, "localized_country_name": "USA", "state": "MT", "address_1": "216 N.

He mentioned three different types of people photos: posed shots, candid shots where people are aware you\u2019re photographing them, and candids where people are unaware that you\u2019re photographing them.</p> <p>This month\u2019s assignment is to concentrate on one of those three types of people shots and practice using some of the other ideas Bret discussed. Bring your best photos to the next club meeting, as well as any questions, problems, or \u201caha\u201d moments that might have occurred while you were photographing.</p> <p>If you were unable to attend the last club meeting, or do not want to practice people photos, an alternative assignment topic is \u201cCold.\u201d This rain can\u2019t last forever, and we still have the month of February. Take some photos that depict \u201cCold\u201d and bring them to the next meeting.</p> <p>Have fun \u2013 shoot lots!</p> <p>Peter T</b></p> <p><br/>Small Conference Room - Missoula County Library \u2013 301 East Main.</p>", "created": 1295307500000, "venue": {"city": "Missoula", "name": "Missoula County Public Library", "zip": "59802", "country": "us", "lon": -113.990976, "localized_country_name": "USA", "phone": "(406)721-2665", "state": "MT", "address_1": "301 East Main", "repinned": false, "lat": 46.869837, "id": 1444906}, "updated": 1297392099000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 4, "state": "MT", "city": "Missoula", "time": 1297387800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "photo_url": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/d/a/global_20880730.jpeg", "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "16084485", "name": "Rocky Mountain Photography Club meeting-February 10, 2011"},{"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": -25200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/WesternMontanaPhotography/events/15103480/", "group": {"who": "Photographers", "name": "Western Montana Photography", "group_lat": 46.86000061035156, "created": 1249738648000, "join_mode": "open", "group_lon": -114.04000091552734, "urlname": "WesternMontanaPhotography", "id": 1503044}, "description": "<p>February's lecture: \"Editorial Portraiture\"</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://www.rmsp.com/\">RMSP Website</a> Winter open lectures. <b>All are invited.</b></p> <p>Beginners to Pro's can learn much from talented accomplished teachers.</p> <p><br/>Presented by: Linda Thompson</p> <p>The lectures are every Third Tuesday of the month from October 2010 to March 2011.

This is a juried collection of color and black &amp; white photographs dedicated to the memory of long-time member Dick Loepp.</p> <p>The Fine Grain Photography Group has been in existence for over thirty years and is an association of local enthusiasts. It was first organized in the late 1970s by six students of accomplished photographer, the late Lee Nye, while he was teaching a series of photography courses at the University of Montana. Nye was the inspiration for founding the Fine Grain Group and served as mentor until 1991, when he became unable to continue due to ill health. RMSP founder/owner Neil Chaput de Saintonge then assumed the role of mentor and group leader in 1991, and for twenty years has provided advice, support, friendship and critical but constructive critiques of their monthly photography assignments.</p> <p><i>Cityscapes and Landscapes</i> will open Friday, April 1, 2011 at Rocky Mountain School of Photography Gallery located at 216 N. Higgins Avenue in downtown Missoula. Some of the artists will be present at the opening, which runs from 5 to 8 p.m.\u00a0</p> <p>The show runs an entire month so if you can't make it to the opening please stop by during normal gallery hours/days.

Each photog to create a Bio (with pic) about them/their art. Surprise! We may have large screen TV's for slideshows! So we can talk about that during Pub Crawl or on the 18th. Vann's has agreed to loan us large screen TV's and players.<br/>Lots of publicity. Plus we can go viral on this ourselves. May have a large turnout by residents to have their pictures taken on the 18th (May).<br/>We can get in as early as we want on the 9th of June to set up. We also need folks to help tear down on the 19 or 20th. Asked if we would charge residents if they want their photos. Suggested they pay for printing, may just send them to the print shop when we get a shop to donate for the show.

Stephanie Foster just contacted us (via Rocky Mountain School of Photography) about our group having a showing at Grizzly Peak Retirement Community in Missoula. The dates of the show June 10th through the 19th. With an open house on the 11th.</p> <p>Of course the show will be open to the public on all dates and not just the open house. What a great opportunity to have your talents and artwork shown to the public! Some things we get to decide: Do we want to do it?</p> <p>If so, meet on the 18th of May at Grizzly Peak Retirement Community for either a 5pm dinner with the residents to get ideas on what photo types they would like and possibly take pictures of them (theme related-Fathers day) Or Meet at 7pm (same date) to walk through the area for display to get ideas on sizing of photos, etc.</p> <p>Also, shall we set up the show Thursday night or Friday-daytime? Please reply at the bottom of this post (or on the poll if it works or both) so we can get a general consensus. I realize that putting a show together this fast is challenging and fun.</p> <p>Please reply ASAP so we can organize all the bits. All votes will be tallied and the group decisions will be announced on Wednesday (here) the 11th. In the event of a tie, Scott or I will make a decision as a tie breaker.</p> <p>If you have a collection of Fathers Day type shots, cool. If you want to take people pictures of the residents (with the residents permission), cool. If neither than when we meet we can get a better idea of the genres each will provide and how many.</p> <p>What a great group event! If we decide to do this then I will also contact printing shops locally to see if they will donate with us to do the printing, framing, etc. Okay quick at it then, decide, post your answers and we\u2019re off!</p>", "created": 1304540925000, "venue": {"city": "Missoula", "name": "Grizzly Peak Retirement Community ", "zip": "59808", "country": "us", "lon": -114.042465, "localized_country_name": "USA", "state": "MT", "address_1": "3600 American Way", "repinned": false, "lat": 46.891781, "id": 1634808}, "updated": 1306160757000, "visibility": "public", "id": "17545564", "yes_rsvp_count": 8, "state": "MT", "city": "Missoula", "time": 1305766800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 7, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "why": "Great opportunity to shine your photo talents on our community!", "name": "Special showing of our photography!"},{"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": -21600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/WesternMontanaPhotography/events/18866521/", "group": {"who": "Photographers", "name": "Western Montana Photography", "group_lat": 46.86000061035156, "created": 1249738648000, "join_mode": "open", "group_lon": -114.04000091552734, "urlname": "WesternMontanaPhotography", "id": 1503044}, "description": "<p>Jelly Meet space!</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>We are holding another Jelly Meeting space for CoWorking on Tuesday the 24th, 2011.</p> <p>All are welcome, bring laptops, work on your own projects, collaborate with others, it's all good.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>What are Jelly meets and this thing about CoWorking? <b><a href=\"http://coworkingmontana.org/why-we-do-what-we-do\">Click here for a video</a></b> describing the core idea.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Feel free to invite others to join you!</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>This weeks Jelly CoWorking space Ambassador is Scott Rouse so look for his smiling face behind his computer downstairs in Zootown Brew coffee shop.

He was able to gain access to places and people normally unseen by the public, including a helicopter flight to a relief well rig at the BP Deepwater Horizon site. The exhibition, <b><i>Flow</i></b>, presents a selection of these compelling images as a record of Nesmith's personal encounter with the region and people.</p> <p>By using historical process and methods developed at the earliest era of photography, Phil Nesmith has been reinterpreting the genres and visual language of the photographic image. His work forms a dialog with Chuck Close, Adam Fuss, and Sally Mann who have re-appropriated early photographic methods for their images.

Warm foregrounds can balance cool backgrounds. One large building on the left can balance three smaller ones on the right. A smaller amount of bright blue sky can balance a larger amount of dark green forest. Size, shape, color, symmetry, even emotional value \u2013 we can all think of concepts that affect visual balance in a photo. For your assignment, bring 3-5 photos that you feel are visually balanced in some way, and why you think they are balanced. We\u2019ll spend a little more time with each photo next month talking about balance.</p> <p>\n\nI\u2019ve included three sources for reference material in case you\u2019re interested. The first is a video tutorial specifically about shooting wide scenic landscapes that discusses other concepts as well as balance, but a lot of the concepts apply to other types of photography as well. The other two references are just sites I Googled that define and give a few examples of visual balance. See you next month!</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tmelive.com/Features/FoundationConcepts/2010/August/BasicCompositionConceptsGrandScale/BasicCompositionConceptsGrandScale.html\"> <a href=\"http://www.tmelive.com/Features/FoundationConcepts/2010/August/BasicCompositionConceptsGrandScale/BasicCompositionConceptsGrandScale.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.tmelive.com/Features/FoundationConcepts/2010/August/BasicCompositionConceptsGrandScale/BasicCompositionConceptsGrandScale.html</a></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sallygentieuwelch.com/pages/balance2.html\"> <a href=\"http://www.sallygentieuwelch.com/pages/balance2.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.sallygentieuwelch.com/pages/balance2.html</a></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.neurosoftware.ro/programming-blog/facebook-web-design/web-design/19-factors-that-impact-compositional-balance/\"> <a href=\"http://www.neurosoftware.ro/programming-blog/facebook-web-design/web-design/19-factors-that-impact-compositional-balance/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.neurosoftware.ro/programming-blog/facebook-web-design/web-design/19-factors-that-impact-compositional-balance/</a></a></p> <p><br/>--------------------------------<br/>Peter Tucker</p> <p>\"</p>", "created": 1305347490000, "venue": {"city": "Missoula", "name": "Missoula County Public Library", "zip": "59802", "country": "us", "lon": -113.990976, "localized_country_name": "USA", "phone": "(406)721-2665", "state": "MT", "address_1": "301 East Main", "repinned": false, "lat": 46.869837, "id": 1444906}, "updated": 1307670399000, "visibility": "public", "id": "18323641", "yes_rsvp_count": 0, "state": "MT", "city": "Missoula", "time": 1307665800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "how_to_find_us": "LARGE conference room downstairs", "name": "Rocky Mountain Photo Club June meeting"},{"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 1, "average": 5}, "utc_offset": -21600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/WesternMontanaPhotography/events/19859631/", "group": {"who": "Photographers", "name": "Western Montana Photography", "group_lat": 46.86000061035156, "created": 1249738648000, "join_mode": "open", "group_lon": -114.04000091552734, "urlname": "WesternMontanaPhotography", "id": 1503044}, "description": "<p>We have been honored by Grizzly Peak Retirement Community to exhibit photographs in honor of Father's Day.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><b>Open to the entire world-free admission/refreshments.</b></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>The show dates;</b></p> <p><b>Opening:</b> June 10th,[masked]am to 8pm.</p> <p><b>Open house/meet the photographers:</b> June 11th: 11am to 4 pm, refreshments will be served this day only.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><b>Show runs from;</b></p> <p>June 1oth to June 19th (Fathers Day)\u00a0 daily, from 9am to 8pm.</p> <p><b>Don't miss it!</b> This is sponsored by donations of space-time-talent by people in our community coming together <i>for</i> our community.</p> <p>The exhibit will be using a minimum of two mediums to show 7 photographers renditions of Father's Day and Montana at large.

This is often the time photographers put away their cameras and wait for a more gentle light to photograph in. But what happens when you have an assignment that must be done during mid day (an event at a certain time, vacation travel, etc.)? This month's assignment is to practice using harsh light in a way that enhances your photos. You might want to consider black and white to enhance the shadows, or use the harsh light as a back light. You don't have to use the sun - it can be a bare flash, a streetlamp, or a flashlight. Experiment, have fun, and bring us your best!</p> <p>Peter</p> <p>Hope to see you all out and about.

There is a soda dispensing machine in the building (bring your own food). There is a projector we can use. There are laptops we can use, already there.

In fact we could do an open call for models for studio shots...just thinking out loud here. \u00a0</p> <p>Peter Dove suggested for our first meeting everyone bring a few photos in (your choice of theme and if a print or on a thumb/jump drive-or CD) and we can look at them, offer opinions, whatever...as part of the meeting.

There are good-to-great pictures and the rest we learn from. \"</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>We can also discuss what topics we would like to cover. Additionally Peter Dove has offered to conduct a class from time to time and I am sure others (all of us) can do a class every so often. Giving a class or a talk is not only <b>easy</b>, the person who volunteers actually gets the most out of it as they get to do research and focus on a particular aspect. So you don't have to know much about that subject or aspect of photography to volunteer, you will learn. <img src=\"http://img2.meetupstatic.com/981263258369601089/img/smileys/smile.gif\" /></p> <p>In fact one can volunteer to do a talk/show &amp; tell on a subject/aspect they are having challenges with!

Bring your manual just in case you aren't sure, we may be able to help. You will need to know how to use Shutter Priority so you can leave the shutter open for 30 seconds (approximately) A tripod! Very very important...no tripod, no meteor pictures. Spare or fully charged batteries for your camera. Large storage, you will be taking lots of photos. Bug repellant. If you don't have any, we may have some you can use. Water or favorite beverage. Snacks in case you get hungry. A chair if you want to sit down...but not on the ground. A hoodie or some such since it can get chilly at night. Maybe long pants-shoes too! Also a good bug deterrent.

Cold night clothes. Layers...as Momma always said 'Better to bring and not need than not bring and wish you had!' Plenty of water! There is a drinking water station there according to the site. Good sturdy hiking boots. Extra batteries! Extra memory cards! Tripod! Food! Coffee-tea, S'Mores...whatever! Back pack for food, gear, camera stuff.

Suggest to pre-charge the batteries the day before. If your batteries haven't had a full charge (typically 5+ hours or overnight) in a long while, spend the few nights before this event to get them fully charged. They last longer and will help you avoid short battery life during this event. TRIPOD and/or Mono pod. You may also be doing a lot of hand held's/run-N-gun shots.. A backup device like a portable Hard drive or a laptop so you can dump your cards in case you don't have a lot of spares. Water bottle as you may not have time to teak a break. Any props (hats, scarves, whatever) you feel may be used in spicing up your shots/models.

Bring whatever you like and give a little demonstration or talk about it.

There is a projector we can use. We can also discuss what topics we would like to cover. Additionally Peter Dove has offered to conduct a class from time to time and I am sure others (all of us) can do a class every so often. Giving a class or a talk is not only <b>easy</b>, the person who volunteers actually gets the most out of it as they get to do research and focus on a particular aspect. So you don't have to know much about that subject or aspect of photography to volunteer, you will learn. <img src=\"http://img2.meetupstatic.com/981263258369601089/img/smileys/smile.gif\" /></p> <p>In fact one can volunteer to do a talk/show &amp; tell on a subject/aspect they are having challenges with!

Weather predictions are cloudy and the moonrise 'guestimate' is for approx 8:52 PM. This is when the moon is at it's closest to the Earth and is up to (visually) 13% larger. The greatest magnification of the Moon happens on the horizon.</p> <p>Suggested that one gets out before the moonrise and pre visualize the horizon with the moon rising...we only have a few minutes to actually 'get' the shot.</p> <p>Keep in mind that if one is in a valley, moonrise can be 'up to' an hour after estimated 'rise' times. So if one wanted to, one could take a first series from a very high vantage point (ex: High up on the 'M' ) and then dash down to the valley and take a second series.</p> <p>A great point Peter Dove made, using the idea above, the first series you make from up high will have the sun setting at the same time so landscape/moon photos will have an illuminated landscape. Second series (from the valley floor) will more than likely be silhouetted landscapes with the brighter full moon and no fill light from the sun.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=46.91611099,-114.09055328\"><b>Check local weather here.</b></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47235294/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/thats-not-just-full-moon-week-its-supermoon/#.T59H7NWJl8E\"><b>Read more about the Super Moon here.</b></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://photonaturalist.net/biggest-full-moon-of-the-year-occurs-this-saturday/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+photonaturalist+%28PhotoNaturalist%29\">A great page to visit on the subject submitted by Ken Stolz:</a></p> <p>Want a lot more precise planning for any Moon-Sun events anywhere in the world-any day/night?

Take that road. The road will divide in two at the beginning, following it to the left. It will even have a sign right now about loggers in the area. The road will turn into a dirt road after a short distance. Drive down that road a couple miles until you reach the sea of purple flowers. You can't miss it. They are on both sides of the road and I could see the purple before I even got there. It is so pretty right now. Much prettier than last year.

So if any of you have always wanted to shoot a wedding nows you chance!</p> <p>If you want to make a weekend out of it, there is a forest service campground at Bass creek. The campgroud is about three miles from the Faire. Other interesting photo ops are the Lee Metcalf Wildlife Refuge, Historic St. Mary's Mission, Kootenai Creek Canyon, Historic Fort Owen, and the Bass Creek Overlook</p> <p>My wife has agreed to host a brats and burgers BBQ for us all on Saturday evening. Probably be in the 6:00 to 7:00 range at my house. I only live about 1.5 miles from the Faire. I will see if I can line up a replica of a 50's Conoco filling station for some dusk/dark photos. It doesn't get dark for quite a while so that may go pretty late.</p>", "created": 1401246525000, "venue": {"city": "Stevensville", "name": "Highway 93", "country": "us", "lon": -114.093651, "localized_country_name": "USA", "state": "MT", "address_1": "North of Stevensville", "repinned": false, "lat": 46.509319, "id": 20364142}, "updated": 1403979164000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 10, "state": "MT", "city": "Missoula", "time": 1403967600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "185564042", "name": "Big Sky Renaissance Faire"},{"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": -21600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/WesternMontanaPhotography/events/188567812/", "group": {"who": "Photographers", "name": "Western Montana Photography", "group_lat": 46.86000061035156, "created": 1249738648000, "join_mode": "open", "group_lon": -114.04000091552734, "urlname": "WesternMontanaPhotography", "id": 1503044}, "description": "<p>Free-form time to practice, share, learn, show and tell new toys, brainstorm, relax, recharge, whatever.

I'll finalize the space to reserve this evening. We will not be using the large studio room, but we will have space outside the gallery room. No easels needed. All wall-mounted.</p> <p><br/>Here's some more about setup and logistics for the show on the WMP message board: <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/WesternMontanaPhotography/messages/boards/thread/45070962\">Gallery Show</a>.</p> <p>For those of you who don't know about MCAT, it is a great resource for video and multimedia production. They provide studio time, video processing workstation use and training, and camera and sound equipment rentals, all for a very low annual fee. And by low, I mean low. No, lower. Lower.

In turn, advances in science and technology have transformed photography and our reliance on the visual image. This lecture will explore some of the major photographers, art movements and scientific advances that have contributed not only to our enjoyment of excellent photographs but also to our ability to use the tools of photography effectively.</p> <p>Herbert will touch on some of the major movements in photography including Pictorialism, the f64 group, and the debate about whether photography was an art or a science, and post-modernism. He will also address some of the major scientific developments and the mutual interfaces of photography and technology, each of which influenced the other, as well as some of the iconic photographers and how they influenced our understanding of art and our world; names such as Steichen, Strand, Adams, Weston and W. Eugene Smith.</p> <p>Herbert Swick has enjoyed photography as a serious hobby for over 40 years, during which time he has become fascinated by the history of photography. He works almost exclusively with traditional black and white film photography, and he develops and prints his images in his own darkroom.
