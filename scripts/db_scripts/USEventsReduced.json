If you are interested in photography, then you are invited. Typically you'll find an easy-going group of individuals who are happy to help and happy to share tips and techniques.</p> <p>We'll meet at the Iron Horse parking lot at 6:30pm and start walking around downtown shortly after that. Sunset is at 8:25pm with civil twilight at 8:57pm.</p> <p>We'll probably try to end up near Iron Horse again by 8:30 or so. The plan is to grab some food and drinks after that.</p> <p>It's free. It's fun. It's educational. It's inclusive.</p> <p>Please feel free to invite anyone you'd like.</p> <p>More information and discussion can be found at the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=105781376116471\">Facebook Event</a>.</p>", "created": 1269273445000, "venue": {"city": "Missoula", "name": "Iron Horse Brew Pub", "zip": "59802", "country": "us", "lon": -113.993018, "localized_country_name": "USA", "phone": "406-728-8866", "state": "MT", "address_1": "501 North Higgins Avenue", "repinned": false, "lat": 46.874515, "id": 1224471}, "updated": 1272725978000, "visibility": "public", "id": "12955815", "yes_rsvp_count": 2, "state": "MT", "city": "Missoula", "time": 1271550600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 1, "photo_url": "http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/7/7/b/global_13838779.jpeg", "maybe_rsvp_count": 4, "how_to_find_us": "Look for us in the parking lot.", "name": "Missoula Spring Photo Walk"}]}
